//! §C: Neighbor Diffusion — 1-hop importance spreading.
//!
//! Collins & Loftus (1975) spreading activation, simplified to single-hop
//! weighted diffusion. Runs in REM sleep daemon as background consolidation.
//!
//! NOTE: This is NOT a full Random Walk with Restart (which iterates to
//! convergence like PageRank). For topology-aware importance, see
//! `graph::pagerank::compute_and_store`.

/// importance to direct neighbors, weighted by relation strength.
///
/// - α=0.85: restart probability (fraction kept by seed)
/// - (1−α)=0.15: fraction diffused to neighbors
